    demand(price, s::Student;p_neigh_parm::Int64=0)

Compute the total demand for classes based on the optimal individual bundles for a `student`.


## Arguments

Assume that N is the number of students, and C the number of classes that are available to choose from.

- `price` : a column vector of dimension C x 1, which i-th element is the price that was assigned to class i.
- `student`: instance of type `Student`

## Example

* 20 individuals
* 10 classes to choose from
* exactly 3 classes to attend
* NO CROSS PREFERENCES, i.e. Individual preferences are generated as an array of sparse diagonal matrices
